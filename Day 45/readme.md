### Overview

Today I revisited requirements gathering in software projects and I also documented the process which includes understanding user needs, defining project scope, and capturing functional and non-functional requirements. 

### Goals

- Understand user needs and pain points
- Define project scope and objectives
- Capture functional and non-functional requirements
- Develop a solid foundation for software development

### Resources

 - Mastering the Requirements Process" by Suzanne Robertson

### What I Learned

- Active listening is crucial during user interviews
- User personas help identify key user needs and goals
- Requirements should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)

### Progress

- Conducted user interviews for my personal project
- Created user personas 
- Defined project scope and objectives of the project

### Next Steps
