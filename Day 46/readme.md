### Overview

Today I had a meeting with my software engineering hands-on team and our focus for today was on understanding and implementation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Steps

1. Requirements Gathering: This is where we identify what users need and want from the software, it is where we identify the pain points and define the project scope and objectives. 

2. Analysis: Here the requirements are break down into manageable tasks and smaller tasks.

3. Design: This is where the ideas are being turned into designs, it is where architecture and user interface prototypes are been created.

4. Implementation: Writing code and building the software.

5. Testing: Verifying and validating the software's quality.

6. Deployment: Releasing the software to production.

7. Maintenance: Updating, fixing, and refining the software.

### What I Learned

I learned about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a process used to design, develop, and deliver software. The Software Development Life Cycle consists of seven phases:

- Requirements Gathering
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

    #### Key Takeaways

- Understanding user needs and defining project scope
- Breaking down requirements into manageable tasks
- Creating architecture and user interface prototypes
- Writing clean, modular, and efficient code
- Ensuring software quality through testing and validation
- Deploying software to production and configuring monitoring tools
- Updating and refining software based on user feedback

### Next Steps

Apply Software Development Life Cycle knowledge to a project

- Apply the SDLC phases to the project
- Document your progress and lessons learned

Explore specific SDLC methodologies

- I will research Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, and other SDLC methodologies
- Compare and contrast their approaches and benefits and
- Choose a methodology I can apply to my next project

Continuously learn and improve

- Stay updated on industry trends and best practices
