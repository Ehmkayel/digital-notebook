## Overview

I'll be dedicating the next 100 days to enhancing my skills. From learning the fundamentals to exploring modern techniques, I'm committed to continuous learning and growth.

Each day, I'll be logging my progress in organized folders, documenting my studies, exercises, and projects. Additionally, I'll be sharing updates on LinkedIn with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode, offering insights, code snippets, and reflections on my journey.

## The Challenge

Welcome to the 100DaysOfCode challenge, over the next 100 days, I'll be embarking on a journey to enhance my coding skills starting from JavaScript. I'll be updating my progress regularly on [Linkedin](linkedin.com/in/morufat-lamidi/), sharing insights, lessons learned, and project updates.

## Goals

 - Solidify my  JavaScript Fundamentals, Asynchronous Programming and Modern JavaScript: I aim to solidify my understanding of core JavaScript concepts to increase my JavaScript foundation.

 - Increasing my Problem-Solving Skills: I'll sharpen my problem-solving skills by tackling coding challenges and algorithm problems and I will be doing that with [Hackerank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), focusing on writing clean, efficient, and bug-free code.

 - JavaScript Frameworks: I will also learn some Javascript frameworks to understand their concepts and also to enhance my previous knowledge in React.js

 - Building Projects: Throughout the challenge, I'll work on various projects, applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios and challenges.

## Daily Log

 I'll be organizing my daily study sessions into folders categorized by each day of the challenge. Each folder will contain my notes, exercises, and any projects I work on for that day. This structured approach will help me stay organized and track my progress throughout the 100DaysOfCode challenge.

 Additionally, I'll be updating my progress daily on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morufat-lamidi/), where I'll share insights, code snippets, project updates, and reflections on my learning journey with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
