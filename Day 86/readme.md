### Overview

Today, I continued working on my internship collaborative project. I made significant progress by ensuring a smooth workflow and clean codebase through intentional organization and collaboration

### Update

- I fetched latest changes and merged to avoid conflicts
- then created a dedicated folder for the assigned page
- I also set up necessary files for the page, including separate data file for organization and easy updates
- I mapped data to relevant sections of the page
- then I imported files into main page file
- Next, I added and pushed updates to repo, then created a pull request

### Key Takeaway

 Maintaining a clean and organized codebase through structured file management and regular merging
