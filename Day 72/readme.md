### Update

- I continued work on my internship project
- Had a call with my lead, he reviewed my work and taught me how to use Cloudinary for image management
- Squeezed in extra time for React studies

### Insights

The importance of using Cloudinary for images includes:
 - Security: All your images are secured
 - Optimization: : It compresses images thereby reducing file size without compromising quality which will in turn leads to faster loading of page.

### Inspiration

 "The only person you should try to be better than is the person you were yesterday." - Matt Giaquinto

I am grateful for my lead's guidance and mentorship and I am glad I could learn best practices from him
