### Internship Project Update

- Completed assigned task and created a pull request
- I had a meeting with my lead for task review and I received feedback on where I need to adjust
- I adjusted the changes he pointed out and updated code

### Git Workflow

Before I continued working the project, I took the following steps

- Fetched latest changes with git fetch origin
- Switched to branch with git switch <branchName>
- Merged latest changes from main branch with git merge origin/main
- Verified current branch with git branch
- Installed dependencies with npm install
- Ran npm run dev to continue working

### Team Collaboration

- Joined scrum meeting with internship team to discuss next steps
- Met with friends to discuss group project progress

### Reflection

- Consistency and accountability are key to progress
- Publicly sharing progress builds trust and motivates continuous improvement
- Small daily efforts lead to significant achievements

### Inspiration

- "Shipping consistently is the secret sauce. Publicly sharing your progress keeps you accountable and builds trust with a potential audience." - Seth Godin
