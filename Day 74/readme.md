### Update

- I started the day feeling lazy but refused to give in and got motivation by watching the Korean movie "Start-Up" 
- Favorite scene: Seo Dal Mi's successful pitch at the three-day hackathon
- Just like what Han Ji-pyeong said in the movie; "Do you know why people are interested in success stories? Because they're not the only ones who dream. It gives hope to those who are still dreaming."
- After the movie, I returned to React studies with renewed energy

### Insights

- Importance of self-motivation and inspiration
- Sometimes, a boost is all you need to overcome laziness
