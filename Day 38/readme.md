## Overview

Clean code refers to well-written, maintainable, and efficient code that is easy to understand and modify. It follows best practices and principles such as simplicity, readability, and testability. Clean code is not just about writing code that works, but also about writing code that is readable, maintainable, and scalable.

## Importance of Clean Code to Developers

Clean code is very important for developers because it:
