### Update

- I started working on a newly assigned page for internship project
- I ensured my local branch was up-to-date with main remote branch by fetching and merging with my branch
- I Created folder and files for assigned task in pages directory
- I noticed the sections had the same structure so I created a reusable component for the page under the reusable directory and I continued working. 
- After I completed the page, I added and committed changes with clear message, and pushed to branch
- I created pull request with a screenshot of the view of the page I worked on and a descriptive message

### Git Workflow

- Fetched and merged with main remote branch to avoid conflicts
- Used git add . , git commit -m "" , and git push to commit and push changes
- Created pull request with screenshot and descriptive message
