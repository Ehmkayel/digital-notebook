### Overview
Today, I dedicated time to learning about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I explored the phases, importance, and benefits of SDLC in software development and I also started working on a teams project.

### What I Learned
I learned about the six phases of SDLC:

1. Requirements Gathering
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

I understood how each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a structured approach to software development.

### Importance of SDLC

- Ensuring timely project delivery
- Meeting user requirements
- Improving code quality and maintainability
- Reducing errors and bugs
- Enhancing team collaboration and communication

### Recommendation
I highly recommend understanding and implementing SDLC in software development projects. It streamlines the development process, leading to better outcomes and increased productivity.
